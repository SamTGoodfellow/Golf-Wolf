Golf Wolf – App Requirements Summary
1. Purpose

Build a mobile-first, responsive web app that helps a group of golfers easily manage and score a round of Wolf golf on the course.

The app should:

Be fast to use on a phone

Require no login

Work in a browser

Feel “app-like” (clean UI, large buttons)

2. Target Users

Casual to regular golfers

Playing informal rounds of Wolf

Typically 3–5 players

Using phones outdoors (gloves, sunlight, poor signal)

3. Core User Flow

Open the app (no sign-up)

Add players and handicaps

Start the game

For each hole:

Select the Wolf

Record the hole winner(s)

Automatically update scores

View running totals

Complete 18 holes

View final leaderboard

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Game Setup

User can add players:

Name (required)

Handicap (integer)

Minimum of 3 players required to start

Players can be edited or removed before starting

No persistence required (session-based is fine for MVP)

4.2 Hole Management

Game tracks holes from 1 to 18

Current hole number is always clearly visible

User can move to the next hole

Wolf resets when moving to the next hole

4.3 Wolf Selection

For each hole, user can select one player as the Wolf

Wolf should be visually highlighted (icon or colour)

Wolf selection should be quick (single tap)

Only one Wolf allowed per hole

4.4 Scoring (MVP Rules)

For the MVP, keep scoring intentionally simple:

User can mark one or more players as “Won Hole”

Each win awards +1 point to that player

Scores are tracked per hole and summed into a total

Advanced Wolf rules (solo wolf, doubles, presses, betting) are explicitly out of scope for v1.

4.5 Score Display

Each player shows:

Name

Handicap

Current total score

Scores update immediately after input

Wolf is clearly marked in the player list

4.6 Leaderboard

App shows a leaderboard:

Players sorted by total score (highest first)

Leaderboard is viewable:

During the round

Automatically at the end of hole 18

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Platform

Mobile-responsive web app

Optimised for phone screens

Should work on:

iOS Safari

Android Chrome

5.2 Usability

Large buttons and touch targets

Minimal typing once game starts

No popups that slow play

Clear visual state (Wolf, hole, score)

5.3 Performance

Instant interactions

No backend required

State can be in memory or browser storage

5.4 Accessibility

High contrast text

Clear labels

Icons supported with text

6. Visual / UX Guidelines

Clean, uncluttered layout

Green primary colour (golf theme)

Wolf indicator (🐺 icon recommended)

One-handed use

No complex navigation (single main screen preferred)

7. Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)

User accounts / login

Betting / money tracking

GPS or course data

Handicap calculations

App Store deployment

Cloud sync or multiplayer online

8. Success Criteria (MVP)

The app is successful if:

A group of golfers can complete a full round

Scoring takes <10 seconds per hole

No one needs instructions after hole 2

The app works reliably on the course

9. Future Enhancements (Not Now)

Full Wolf rules engine

Persistent game history

Offline-first PWA

Native mobile app

Sharing results

Payments / betting modes

10. One-Sentence Summary (for Replit)
